# Exercises for University Physics with Modern Physics 14th Ed

I'm completing exercises from this textbook as an alternative to my classroom work, as permitted by my Physics teacher.

## Environment

1. Copy the most recently completed excerise's `.tex` file and rename the new `.tex` file accordingly.
2. Use `latexmk -pdf <filename>.tex` to compile the `.tex` file to `.pdf`.
3. Use `xdg-open <filename>.pdf` to view the PDF.
4. Now, simply write in the `.tex` file using your preferred editor (e.g. `vim <filename>.tex`) and the PDF viewer should automatically update as you save.
5. When you're done completing the exercise, execute `latexmk -c` to clean any temporary files.

## Thank you

Thank you, Mr. D, for letting me complete exercises from this textbook as opposed to the ordinary classroom work that you assign. I honestly find it much more interesting when I learn on my own motivation, rather than as assigned.

Also, thanks to [this repository](https://github.com/RandyMcMillan/PHY2049/tree/master/University%20Physics%20with%20Modern%20Physics,%2014th%20Edition) for providing this textbook in PDF format for free.
