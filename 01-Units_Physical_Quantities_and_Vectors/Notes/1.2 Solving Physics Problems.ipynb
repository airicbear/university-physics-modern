    "- In physics a **model** is a simplified version of a physical system that would be too complicated to analyze in full detail\n",

    "\n",
    "    - E.g. If we ignore the effects of gravity completely, then our model predicts that when we throw the ball up, it will go in a straight line and disappear into space\n",

    "    - A useful model simplifies a problem enough to make it manageable, yet keeps its essential features\n",
    "    \n",
    "- The validity of the predictions we make using a model is limited by the validity of the model\n",
    "\n",
    "    - E.g. Galileo's prediction about falling objects corresponds to an idealized model that does not  include the effects of air resistance. This model works fairly well for a dropped cannonball, but not so well for a feather."
